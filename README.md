A work-in-progress to rewrite an improved memepoke entirely within the rust stack., while simultaneously learning rust & web development - what could possibly go wrong?

Frontend: Yew, Yew Router, Bootstrap
Backend: Actix Web, Actix Web Client (To-Be-Decided Relational Database)

Login makes use of reddit api (installed app <- does not hold/make use of secrets) to get username.

Databse and MemeScraper not yet implemented.

I am aware it is intensely messy & unfinished, has been rewritten 3+ times. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
